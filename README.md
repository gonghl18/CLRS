# Introduction_To_Algs
Some algorithms in the **introduction to algorithms**. :smile:   

1. [insertion sort and merge sort](./algs/sort.cpp) This cpp contains algorithm for insertation sort and merge sort.
2. [The maximum-subarray problem](./algs/max_sub.cpp) This cpp contains three algorithms for solving maximum-subarray problem. A brute-force solution with complexity $O(n^2)$. A solution using divide-and-conquer with complexity $O(n\log n)$. A linear solution with $O(n)$.
3. [Strassen Algorithm for matrix multiplication](./algs/strassen.cpp) This cpp contains a simple **Matrix** class and a simple implementation for Strassen Algorithm (only for 2^n square matrix). But performs not good. :sweat:
